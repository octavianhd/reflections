1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'm using another computer or when someone wants to work on my project.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pull changes manually is the best option because:
   * I'm working to a new branch,or I'm trying something new and I don't want to merge in master branch;
   *Somebody else is working on my project and I dont't know yet what are they doing.

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clones are the method of geting on my computer both forks and branches from GitHub. When I push my commits to GitHub my fork repository is updated, but not the original repository I've have forked on.The branch I have been pushed on GitHub will be beside the master branch and can be merge in it. I would use forks when I want to have a version of the forked repository and change it as I like. I would use branches when I'm working on a project whith other people and my branch it can be usefull for them and for the project.
