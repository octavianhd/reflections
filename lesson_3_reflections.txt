When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'm using another computer or when someone wants to work on my project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pull changes manually is the best option because:
   * I'm working to a new branch,or I'm trying something new and I don't want to merge in master branch;
   *Somebody else is working on my project and I dont't know yet what are they doing.
